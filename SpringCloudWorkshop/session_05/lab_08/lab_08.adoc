== Creating Service Instances

. The Fortune service stores the fortunes in a database. 
From the CLI, let's _create_ a free MySQL service instance:
+
----

$cf create-service p-mysql 100mb-dev fortune-db
Creating service instance fortune-db in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK

----

. Next we'll create an instance of the config service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-config-server standard config-server
Creating service instance config-server in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Now, we need an instance of the service registry service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-service-registry standard service-registry
Creating service instance service-registry in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. The final service that we need is for the circuit breaker dashboard.
+
----
$cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker
Creating service instance circuit-breaker in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----
+
. We need to initialize each of the Spring Cloud Services.  Open the Application Manager console and scroll down until you see the Spring Cloud services.  Under the "config-server", click "Manage".
+

+
. You should see a blank page for the Config Server.
+
image::../../Common/images/ConfigServerUp.png[]
+
. Later you will set up your own configuration repository in Github.  For now, enter "https://github.com/mstine/config-repo".
+

+
. Go back to the Application Manager console and click "Manage" under "service-registry".  When the service has initialized you should a screen similar to the following:
+

+
. Go back to the Application Manager console and click "Manage" under "circuit-breaker".  When the service has initialized you should a screen similar to the following:

== Push the applications

. Change to the directory that contains fortune-ui and fortune-teller-fortune-service.
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_05/lab_08/fortune-teller
----

. Open the manifest.yml file.  Notice the application names and the service bindings.
